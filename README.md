# Portfolio Terminal - An Interactive Developer Portfolio

![Portfolio Screenshot](./.github/assets/portfolio-preview.png) Welcome to my personal portfolio, redesigned from the ground up to be more than just a resume. This project is an immersive, interactive "terminal" experience that showcases my skills and projects in a creative, developer-focused environment.

## ‚ú® Features

This portfolio is built as a cohesive application with a unified, high-tech theme.

- **Interactive Terminal UI:** The entire portfolio is designed to feel like a modern, interactive terminal, from the "boot-up" sequence on the hero section to the "Git log" style project showcase.
- **Live Animated Background:** A performant, interactive canvas animation of a binary field runs across the entire site, reacting to the user's mouse movements.
- **Thematic Components:** Every section is a creative interpretation of a developer tool:
  - **About:** An "IDE-style" bio with interactive keywords that reveal tooltips on hover.
  - **Experience:** A "system event log" that details my professional history with a live typewriter effect.
  - **Projects:** A "Git commit log" that showcases my work as a series of commits.
  - **Contact:** An interactive "SSH connection" sequence that resolves into a functional contact form.
- **Fully Responsive:** The entire application is meticulously designed to be smooth, performant, and visually consistent on all devices, from the smallest phone to the widest desktop.
